This is the repo for the HTC Holiday and its' variants, AT&T Vivid (US) and HTC Raider (WWE).

The files contained in this repository are for building Android 4.0.X (AKA Ice Cream Sandwich) with CyanogenMod 9.X
To build correctly, you must also download the proprietary files contained in this project's sister repo (android_vendor_htc_holiday)

Special thanks to IanWizard (testing, kernels, all around awesomeness) and Tiamat (awesome kernel work backporting Linux 3.0's drivers to 2.6.X), without both this project would not exist!

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING:
1. Get the CyanogenMod 9 ICS branch checked out to your PC
2. Download this repo to device/htc/holiday, and download my other repo "android_vendor_htc_holiday" to vendor/htc/holiday
3. issue ". build/envsetup.sh" then run "lunch full_holiday-eng"
5. Now that you've got the build environment set up, you're ready to build.

Building is as simple as:

1) For building a FULL android image (takes about 50 mins on a fast computer):
	"export USE_CCACHE=1; time mka bacon"
   USE_CCACHE enables the build process to be sped up a lot by caching compiled files (useful if you're "make clean"-ing a lot)

2) For building JUST a recovery image (takes about 15 seconds on my pc):
	"export USE_CCACHE=1; time mka recoveryimage"
   (the export statement can be left out if you've set it previously)

3) For building a boot.img only:
	"export USE_CCACHE=1; time mka bootimage"

4) If you make any changes to any makefiles, you'll have to clean the build output directory, do so with:
	"make clean"
   This is a synonym for "make clobber", the two are apparently interchangable.

Once your build finishes, just type "cd $OUT" to be brought to the output directory, you'll find whatever you just built there.

Also, some neat tricks I usually use:

1) "cdev" command
   From the device/htc/holiday directory, issue: alias cdev="cd `pwd`"
   Now, wherever you are, you can just type "cdev" to be brought back to the device directory.

2) "croot" command
   This is automatically added as an alias when you use ". build/envsetup.sh" to set up your build environment.
   It will bring you back to the root build folder (aka "android")

3) Lots of patience.
   This one is tricky, you might want to try playing a movie in the background while your bacon comes to a sizzle on your CPU heatsink.
   (Trust me, you'll find out if your PC's overclock is stable while "mka bacon" runs-- that, and you'll discover truly how fast paint dries.)
